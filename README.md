# Hi folks and welcome to my GitHub profile! ⛰️
## Brief introduction
I'm Roberto (nickname `rozzilla`), young software engineer excited to do full-stack web development, to work with open source languages (like Node.js and Javascript) and technologies (for example Vue Storefront) on the backend and frontend, and to contribute to open-source projects.

## 🔭 What you can find on my profile?
- personal projects
- contributions I made to open source projects, like the official [PayPal module for Vue Storefront](https://github.com/develodesign/vsf-payment-paypal)
- algorithms solutions, like the [find adjacent boxes recursively in a matrix](https://gist.github.com/rozzilla/8878827106b7def80fd7fdec1f97dfed)

I love trekking ⛰️, chess ♟️, playing music 🎹, read books 📚, and too many other things (like playing Super Mario 🎮) that I sadly had not enough time to do 🤣.
