- personal projects
- contributions I made to open source projects, like the official [PayPal module for Vue Storefront](https://github.com/develodesign/vsf-payment-paypal)

I love trekking ⛰️, read books 📚, playing music 🎹, chess ♟️, table tennis 🏓, and too many other things (like playing Super Mario 🎮) that I sadly had not enough time to do 🤣
